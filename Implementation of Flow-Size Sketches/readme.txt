1. This project includes:
----three java files: countMin.java, counter_sketch.java and active_counter.java.
----three outpur files: countMin_output.java, counter_sketch_output.java and active_counter_output.java.
----this readme.txt.



2. Executable files can be produced by:
----javac countMin.java
or
----javac counter_sketch.java
or
----javac active_counter.java



3. After producing executable files, output files can be generated by following format:
----java countMin inputfile number_of_counter_arrays number_of_counters_in_each_array
or
----java counter_sketch inputfile number_of_counter_arrays number_of_counters_in_each_array
or
----java active_counter length_of_number_part length_of_exponent_part



4. The hash function of these three files is performed by:
1) flowid.hashCode(). Since flowid is a string, so the native hash function can be used to hash flowid.
2) for algorithms which need multiple hash functions, the result of step 1 is further XOR by a set of random numbers.
