1. This project includes:
----three java files: bloom_filter.java, counting_bloom_filter.java and coded_bloom_filter.java.
----three output files generated using demo parameters: bloom_filter_output.txt, counting_bloom_filter.txt, coded_bloom_filter.txt.
----this readme.txt.



2. Executable files can be produced by:
----javac bloom_filter.java
or
----javac counting_bloom_filter.java
or
----javac coded_bloom_filter.java



3. After producing executable files, output files can be generated by following format:
----java bloom_filter elements_num bits_num hash_num
or
----java counting_bloom_filter elements_initial elements_removed elements_added counter_num hash_num
or
----java coded_bloom_filter set_num element_num filter_num bits_num_each_filter hash_num



4. To make sure there are no duplicate flow ids:
First, the range of number of random flow ids is very large:1 - 100000000. 
Second, HashSet is used to store flow ids so no duplicates will exist.
