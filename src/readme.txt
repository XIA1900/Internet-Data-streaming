1. This project includes:
----three java files: multi_hashing.java, dleft_hashing.java and cuckoo_hashing.java.
----three output files generated by demo parameters: multi_hashing_output.txt,   dleft_hashing_output.txt and cuckoo_hashing_output.txt.

2. Executable files can be produced by:
----javac multi_hashing.java
or
----javac dleft_hashing.java
or
----javac cuckoo_hashing.java

3. After producing executable files, output files can be generated by using following format:
---- java multi_hashing entries_num flow_num hash_num
or
---- java dleft_hashing entries_num flow_num hash_num
or
---- java cuckoo_hashing entries_num flow_num hash_num cuckoo_steps
Note that entries_num, flow_num, hash_num, cuckoo_steps should all be integers.

4. To make sure there are no duplicate flow ids:
First, the range of number of random flow ids is very large:1 - 100000000. 
Second, HashSet is used to store flow ids so no duplicates will exist.
